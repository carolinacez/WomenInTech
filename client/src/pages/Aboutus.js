        <p> We are a mission based company. 
            We sell different type of merchandise which 50% of the proceeds 
            got to supporting women of all ages who want to get into tech.
            As a minority in this industry we feel like it's important to support 
            and inspire women to get into tech.
            Please checkout our merch in the products section and sign up or login to checkout more resources 
            on how women can get started in the tech industry or other ways on how to support women in tech.</p>
